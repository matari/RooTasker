**RooTasker** is a powerful task automation extension for VS Code that seamlessly integrates with [Roo Code](https://roocode.com/). It provides both advanced task scheduling and intelligent file watching capabilities to streamline your development workflow.

## Key Features

### üïí Advanced Task Scheduling

Schedule tasks to run automatically based on various timing options:

- **One-time Tasks**: Schedule a task for a specific date and time
- **Interval Tasks**: Configure tasks to run at regular intervals (minutes, hours, days)
- **Recurring Tasks**: Set up tasks that repeat daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly
- **Cron-based Tasks**: Use cron expressions for complex, precise scheduling
- **Day Selection**: Configure tasks to run only on specific days of the week
- **Time Windows**: Set start and expiration dates to control when schedules are active
- **Execution Limits**: Set maximum number of times a task should run
- **User Activity Awareness**: Optionally run tasks only when there's been user activity

### üîç File Watching

Automate responses to file system changes:

- **Directory Monitoring**: Watch specific directories for file changes
- **File Type Filtering**: Configure watchers to only trigger on specific file types
- **Custom Prompts**: Define custom instructions for Roo Code when files change
- **Mode Selection**: Choose which Roo Code mode to use when responding to changes

### ‚öôÔ∏è Task Execution Options

Fine-tune how tasks interact with your workflow:

- **Wait Mode**: Wait for a specified period of inactivity before executing a task
- **Interrupt Mode**: Automatically interrupt any running task to execute the scheduled task
- **Skip Mode**: Skip execution if another task is already running

### üîå Seamless Roo Code Integration

RooTasker connects with [Roo Code](https://roocode.com/)'s extension points to:

- Start new tasks in any available Roo Code mode
- Pass custom instructions to Roo Code for each task
- Maintain task history and status tracking

### ü§ñ AI Assistant Access

Control RooTasker through AI assistants using the Model Context Protocol (MCP):

- Manage schedules and watchers directly through chat interfaces
- Create, update, delete, and run tasks programmatically
- Toggle schedule activation states
- Get detailed information about your automation setup

## Use Cases

- **Automated Code Reviews**: Schedule regular code quality checks
- **Real-time Testing**: Run tests automatically when code files change
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- **Dependency Checks**: Regularly verify and update project dependencies
- **Codebase Analysis**: Run periodic analysis to identify optimization opportunities
- **Custom Workflows**: Automate any repetitive development task with natural language instructions

## Usage Tips

- RooTasker will run tasks if your screen is locked, but cannot wake up your computer
- When VS Code starts or wakes up, any pending tasks will execute
- For one-time and interval tasks with specific start times, next execution times are calculated from the scheduled time (e.g., 10:00am, 11:00am) regardless of when the previous task actually ran
- For interval tasks without specific start times, next execution times are calculated from the previous execution time
- File watchers trigger only when actual changes are detected, not simply when files are accessed

## Getting Started

1. Open the RooTasker panel in VS Code's activity bar
2. Switch between the "Scheduled Tasks" and "Watchers" tabs
3. Click "Add Schedule" or "Add Watcher" to create new automations
4. Configure your automation parameters and save
5. Monitor task execution in the status list
